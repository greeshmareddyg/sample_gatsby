<PageDescription>

I am [**Greeshma Reddy**](https://github.com/greeshmareddyg). Here I am creating an application using
[Gatsby theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/)
that empowers developers, writers, and designers to create fast, accessible
sites that look and feel like Carbon.

This application includes these activities.

1. **Creating site**

2. **Start developing**

3. **Make some changes!**


Here is the github repo link for this application. Clone it using the below:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/greeshmareddyg/sample_gatsby.git
   ```
